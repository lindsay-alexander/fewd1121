                <h2>Sahasrara | Crown</h2>
                <h3>/thought/</h3>
                <h4>creativity, beauty, wisdom, generosity, knowledge, spiritual connection</h4>
                <p>Sahasrara or crown chakra is generally considered to be the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the Kundalini energy rises to this point, it unites with the male Shiva energy, and a state of liberating samadhi is attained. Symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals, it is located either at the crown of the head, or above the crown of the head.</p>

            <h3>/light/</h3>
            <h4>serenity, stillness, intuition, awareness, psychic perception & imagination</h4>
            <p>Ajna or third-eye chakra, is linked to the pineal gland which may inform a model of its envisioning. The pineal gland is a light sensitive gland that produces the hormone melatonin which regulates sleep and waking up, and is also postulated to be the production site of the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine, the only known hallucinogen endogenous to the human body. Ajna’s key issues involve balancing the higher and lower selves and trusting inner guidance. Ajna’s inner aspect relates to the access of intuition. Mentally, Ajna deals with visual consciousness. Emotionally, Ajna deals with clarity on an intuitive level.</p>
